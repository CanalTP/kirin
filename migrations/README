Generic single-database configuration.

The database schema is maintained using [alembic] and migration files you can
find in `kirin/migrations/versions`. They each contain an `upgrade()` and a
`downgrade()` function.

To create a new migration file, you can use the following command from
`kirin/migrations` folder.

```sh
PYTHONPATH="../:$PYTHONPATH" alembic revision -m "useful commit description"
```

This will create a new file in `kirin/migrations/versions` that you can edit to
express the logic of the migration.

To set up or upgrade your DB to the latest version, you can use.

```sh
honcho run ./manage.py db upgrade
```
