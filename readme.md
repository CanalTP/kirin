Kirin deals with real-time updates for navitia.
When feeds are provided to Kirin by a client, it requests navitia to find the corresponding vehicle journey and apply the update, that is then posted in a queue for navitia to pick.

The feeds can be of the following type:
- IRE : A proprietary realtime information feed for SNCF. XML files are posted to the Kirin web service
  (example of such feed [here](https://github.com/CanalTP/kirin/blob/master/tests/fixtures/train_96231_delayed.xml)).
- COTS : Also a proprietary realtime information feed for SNCF. JSON files are posted to the Kirin web service
  (example of such feed
  [here](https://github.com/CanalTP/kirin/blob/master/tests/fixtures/cots_train_96231_delayed.json)).
  A cause message subservice is also requested during the processing of this feed.
- GTFS-RT : A realtime information format that comes with the GTFS format (base-schedule informations).
  Documentation is available [here](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/?hl=en).
  Typically, a transport authority will provide a server where GTFS-RT protobuf files can be consumed and
  regularly polled.


## Setup

 - Install dependencies with
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (virtualenv is strongly advised)
 - Create a configuration file by copying and editing ```kirin/default_settings.py```
 - You also need a redis-server to use cache on some requests and a rabbitmq-server to post updated data in the queue.
    It can be installed with :
    ```
    sudo apt-get install redis-server rabbitmq-server
    ```
 - Setup the Kirin database (postgresql >= 9.1 is required):
    ```
    sudo -i -u postgres
    # Create a user
    createuser -P navitia (password "navitia")

    # Create database
    createdb -O navitia kirin

    # Create database for tests
    createdb -O navitia chaos_testing
    ctrl + d
    ```

 - Create a file ```.env``` with the path to you configuration file:
    ```
    KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE=default_settings.py
    KIRIN_LOG_FORMATTER='json'  # If you wish to have logs formated as json (more details)
    ```
 - Build the protocol buffer files
    ```
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ./setup.py build_pbf
    ```
 - Build the version file:
    ```
    ./setup.py build_version
    ```
 - Update the database schema (requires honcho):
    ```
    pip install honcho
    honcho run ./manage.py db upgrade
    ```
 - Run the development server:
    ```
    honcho start
    ```
    This command runs several processes :
    - a server to listen to incoming requests
    - a scheduler and its worker to perform tasks scheduled in KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE
      Note: one of the tasks scheduled is a poller to retrieve GTFS-RT files, only useful when there's a feed provider URL defined.
      If not needed, this specific task can be disabled in KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE by removing the 'poller' task in the 'CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE' section. This will avoid having logs and errors about GTFS-RT.
    - a job to read the info already available in Kirin database. Note that this step of data reloading at boot is mandatory for Kirin to be able to process future real-time feeds.
 - Enjoy: you can now request the Kirin API


## API

Kirin API provides several endpoints (that can be requested through port 5000 by default, or
port 54746 if using honcho).  
To list all available endpoints:
```
curl 'http://localhost:5000/'
```


##### Status (GET)

Returns info about the Kirin and the previous jobs performed
```
curl 'http://localhost:5000/status'
```
In the response received:
- last_update: last time Kirin received a file (or pulled it, depending the client) in order to update navitia data.
- last_valid_update: last time Kirin received a file that was valid and managed to update navitia data properly.
- last_update_error: information about error from the last time Kirin processed a file and a problem occurred. It can either be a problem about the file or the data update. The field will be empty if last_update = last_valid_update.
- navitia_url: root url of the navitia server used to consolidate real-time information received by Kirin.  
Other info are available about Kirin ("version"), the database ("db_version", "db_pool_status") and the rabbitmq ("rabbitmq_info").


##### SNCF's realtime feeds

For the SNCF's realtime feeds to be taken into account by navitia, some parameters need to be set
for both Kirin and Kraken (the navitia core calculator).

- In Kirin:
    - KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE:
    ```
    NAVITIA_URL = '<url of the navitia server>' # ex: 'http://localhost:5000/'
    NAVITIA_INSTANCE = '<name of the instance which vehicle journeys will be updated>'
    DEBUG = True
    log_formatter = 'json'
    ```
- In Kraken:
    - kraken.ini:
    ```
    [GENERAL] # The following parameters need to be added to the already existing ones in the GENERAL section
    is_realtime_enabled = true
    kirin_timeout = 180000 # in ms (optional)

    [BROKER] # It represents the rabbitmq-server, fill the following parameters according to your settings
    host = localhost
    port = 5672
    username = guest
    password = guest
    exchange = navitia
    ```


###### Ire (POST)

Post an IRE update file with modifications about a vehicle journey (delay, disruption, deletion, ...) that will be modified and posted in the rabbitmq queue.
```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/ire' -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' -d @<PATH/TO/my_ire.xml>
```
For the IRE to be taken into account by navitia, please add the common SNCF's parameters above, plus:
- In Kraken:
    - kraken.ini:
    ```
    [BROKER] # in the BROKER section existing from common part
    rt_topics = realtime.ire  # it's possible to add multiple topics simultaneously
    ```

If the IRE was successfully sent and processed by Kirin, the http response 200 will have a message "OK".


###### Cots (POST)

Post a COTS update file with modifications about a vehicle journey (delay, disruption, deletion, ...)
that will be modified and posted in the rabbitmq queue.
```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/cots' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @<PATH/TO/my_cots.json>
```
For the COTS to be taken into account by navitia, please add the common SNCF's parameters above, plus:
- In Kirin:
    - KIRIN_CONFIG_FILE:
    ```
    # Parameters for COTS cause message subservice (ParIV)
    COTS_PAR_IV_API_KEY = '<COTS ParIV API key>'
    COTS_PAR_IV_MOTIF_RESOURCE_SERVER = '<COTS ParIV-Motif cause endpoint's URL>'
    COTS_PAR_IV_TOKEN_SERVER = '<COTS ParIV oauth2 token endpoint's URL>'
    COTS_PAR_IV_CLIENT_ID = '<COTS ParIV username>'
    COTS_PAR_IV_CLIENT_SECRET = '<COTS ParIV password>'
    ```
- In Kraken:
    - kraken.ini:
    ```
    [BROKER] # in the BROKER section existing from common part
    rt_topics = realtime.cots  # it's possible to add multiple topics simultaneously
    ```

If the COTS was successfully sent and processed by Kirin, the http response 200 will have a message "OK".


## Development

To generate a new migration script for database (after an upgrade of the model.py file):
```
honcho run ./manage.py db migrate
```
This will generate a new migration file, that you can amend to your will.


### Tests

Most tests are implemented in `/tests` directory.  
Please read [tests readme](https://github.com/CanalTP/kirin/blob/master/tests/readme.md) for more information.


### Troubleshooting

##### Retrieve processed feed

###### pgAdmin

To use pgAdmin, simply `File/add server` then Enter any `name` then
`Host`, `user` and `password` used by Kirin on given platform.   
If you use pgAdmin, you can increase massively the number of characters per column
(as the feed is big):
`File/preferences` then `Request editor/Request editor/Maximum number of characters per column`


###### IRE

To retrieve an IRE feed concerning a given train number at a given date,
you can connect to the given base and execute the following command:
```sql
SELECT * FROM real_time_update WHERE connector = 'ire' AND raw_data
    LIKE '%<NumeroTrain>009580/1</NumeroTrain><DateCirculation>26/10/2018%'
    ORDER BY received_at desc;
```
Pay attention to the train number that can mix multiple and can contain trailing 0.


### Release

To generate a new release:
1. merge the version you want to release into release branch (adapt script):
   ```bash
   git checkout release
   git merge canaltp/master
   ```
2. tag and annotate the version:
   ```bash
   git tag -a <version> # then annotate with 'Version <version>'
   # check that the version is OK
   git describe # should output the desired version
   ```
3. if needed merge back release into master branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git merge release
   ```
4. push master, release and tags to central repo
   ```bash
   git push canaltp release master --tags
   ```


### Docker

A docker image of Kirin can be built using the Dockerfile:
`docker build -t kirin .`
When running this image, the Kirin web server is launched and an optional *port* can be given to expose the API.
`docker run -p <port>:9090 kirin`


Note: a Kirin database is needed on localhost for the requests to be done successfully.
